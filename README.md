# Data Security Project


This project implements the Improved method using two Exclusive-OR to a binary image in RGB color image steganography algorithm 
which described here: https://www.sciencepubco.com/index.php/ijet/article/view/19692

The project is an OO final project of Data Security course.

The encrypted image had been saved as colorImage.png whereas decrypted image was saved as a binaryImage.png.

In addition, we added 3 improvements to the algorithm:
1. Resizing images before encryption to improve algorithm speed.
2. Flipping bits to improve the security.
3. Checksum to each pixel to improve data transformation reliability.

You can see an example of the algorithm implementation in [this video](https://youtu.be/c1HhNfFh8F0)
